  # Python - Cocktail Drink Information
In this program, I utlized an API that provided information on 500+ drinks, from there I developed code to pull-out drinks from the cocktail Dictionary by using Keys to get their respective values. This program, provides the inputted drink's ingredients and recipe with the appropriate measurements and instruction.

  # Python - Artist Recommender 
In this project, I used the musicgraph Api to pull information on popular artists based on total followers, popularity, and genre to provide possible recommendations the user might like. This then outputs, a visual providing information on why this artist was chosen.

# SQL - Database Management
In this project I managed a database for a client with a diverse array of Sci-fi products. I first created tables and then based off a conceptual model built the relationship between them, these table are Project Transaction Part, Project part, Project Transaction, and Project Transaction Type. Next, I input the necessary values into each table, identifying Foriegn keys and references along the way. At the end of this, I wrote queries to pull information based on conditionals, Joins, and Aggregate functions.

# R Work Sample - Customer Flight Satisfaction 
This was my favorite project to work on, where I analyzed customer data looking at Descriptive, Diganostic, and Prescriptive analytics to provide recommendations and reasoning towards low flight satisfaction for customers. While working on this project, I played around alot when analyzing the statistics to identify important attributes to focus in on. There were a few steps in the process to recieve these recommendations, they were Data Cleansing, Data Munging, Data Manipulation, and Data Visualization. In the Data Visualization part, I used ggplot2 to make a world map showing flight paths based  on identified low customer satisfaction levels. There are alot of comments throughout this project to help keep stats documented as well as help orgnaze thought towards next steps.

  # Supervised Machine Learning | R : Predicting Customer Churn - Telco 
This project was completed to further my understanding and practice with Data & Data Science. This project focused on Supervised Machine Learning with  Decision Tree Classification, to predict customer churn. After a thorough Analysis a Predective model was developed, trained, and pruned to refine model to best fit the entire customer population, instead of overfitting the model to the Training and Test data. This Project includes Documented Information on understanding the analysis and the R code developed for the project.

   # Haskell Files 
Understanding Haskell after I learned Python was difficult but some of the skills and general concepts are transferable from python but would take a bit more code to get across since Haskell is a compiled langauge. These Files include my work with Algebraic Data types, Anonymous Functions, Trees, IO, and Turing machines. There are a few skills that are sprinkled throughout these works like List Comprehension, Nested Functions, and Loops. Each Folder contains the necessary files to run the full programs, for example the defined data types constructed for the game.
