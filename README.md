# Portfolio
This is an a current portfolio with academic and personal projects, I am working on.

# Projects 

# Python - Artist Recommender 
In this project, I used the musicgraph Api to pull information on popular artists based on total followers, popularity, and genre to provide possible recommendations the user might like. This then outputs, a visual providing information on why this artist was chosen. 
  
    # Modules Used: 
    Spotipy
    Pandas
    Requests
    Matplotlib
    Plotly
    Cufflinks
    Sys
    Random
   
# Sql - Managing a Database 
In this project I managed a database for a client with a diverse array of Sci-fi products. I first created tables and then based off a conceptual model built the relationship between them, these table are Project Transaction Part, Project part, Project Transaction, and Project Transaction Type. Next, I input the necessary values into each table, identifying Foriegn keys and references along the way. At the end of this, I wrote queries to pull information based on conditionals, Joins, and Aggregate functions.

# R - Low Flight Satisfaction 
This was my favorite project to work on, where I analyzed customer data looking at Descriptive, Diganostic, and Prescriptive analytics to provide recommendations and reasoning towards low flight satisfaction for customers. While working on this project, I played around alot when analyzing the statistics to identify important attributes to focus in on. There were a few steps in the process to recieve these recommendations, they were Data Cleansing, Data Munging, Data Manipulation, and Data Visualization. In the Data Visualization part, I used ggplot2 to make a world map showing flight paths based  on identified low customer satisfaction levels. There are alot of comments throughout this project to help keep stats documented as well as help orgnaze thought towards next steps.

 # Haskel Files 
These were the toughest assignements I worked on, some of these skills and general concepts are transferable to python but would take a bit more code to get across since Haskell is a compiled langauge. These Files includes work on Algebraic Data types, Anonymous Functions, Trees, IO, and Turing machines. There are a few skills that are sprinkled throughout these works like List Comprehension, Nested Functions, and Loops. Each Folder contains the necessary files to run the full programs, for example the defined data types constructed for the game.
